				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I used p5.js to generate a procedural underwater scene with fish, bubbles, and a procedurally generated ocean floor.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The fish are drawn to the screen with the help of ChatGPT, while the bubbles were drawn by me with time based animations, and are moveable with the mouse X. Clicking "New Fish" regenerates the scene with a new random seed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was harder than the first experiment, because I had to figure out how to get everything working correctly (I broke it more times than I care to admit). However, I really enjoyed this experiment! I was able to use a lot of CMPM169 p5js sketches to help me along the way, so I wasn't completely new to it.</p>
