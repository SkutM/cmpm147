				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment explores procedural worldbuilding using Perlin noise and random walk algorithms. The world can be toggled between two modes: a natural overworld and a dungeon interior. Each scene has its own generative logic, tileset, and decor logic for dynamic variation.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					The overworld is generated using Perlin noise to create smooth transitions between water and grass, with added randomized visual variety like trees and rocks. The dungeon uses a room-and-hallway algorithm: several rooms are randomly placed, and hallways are carved to connect their centers.
					<br><br>
					Tiles are drawn using a tileset, and decor (trees, doors, rocks, etc.) is layered with probabilities. Life is added to the world through subtle animations: water tiles shimmer over time using `millis()`, and trees shift slightly based on `mouseX`.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					I struggled a bit with the logic for drawing edge-based tiles and making sure wall tiles only spawn doors when touching floor tiles. I also had to figure out how to introduce "life" with mouse or time interaction, which ended up being fun and not too hard using `sin(millis())` and `map(mouseX)`. The project helped me better understand procedural generation and how to work with 2D arrays to render complex tilemaps.
