					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I am a fourth year CS:GD student and trying to get done with school! The most interesting thing about me is that I broke three bones last year. The photo you see above is of my fractal tree maze generator I worked on in CMPM 169, where the green dot at the top can only traverse down the blue paths to get to the bottom! This was my favorite tree generation, but it didn't actually have a path to the bottom in this version. It took... forever to get working.</p>
